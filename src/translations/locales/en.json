Real-time synchronisation with the database ensures that all information is up-to-date and accurate.",
        "content_context_gemu": "As a student entrepreneur with a passion for e-sports and video games, I set about developing a mobile application designed to create a community around these themes. For a year, while learning Flutter, I worked on creating version 1 of this application. Developed in Flutter and linked to a Firebase server, it aims to connect fans of e-sports and video games through a dedicated social network.",
        "challenges_content_gemu": "This personal project presented a number of challenges. On the one hand, learning Flutter while developing the application was a rewarding but demanding experience. On the other hand, designing a captivating and functional user experience, capable of bringing together a diverse community around video games and e-sports, required particular attention. In addition, integrating with Firebase to manage real-time data, user authentication and other backend functionality was a crucial stage of the project.",
        "results_content_gemu": "Version 1 of the application was successfully launched, reflecting both my apprenticeship in mobile development and my passion for e-sports. The app offers users a platform where they can exchange, connect and share their experiences of video games. Although this is a first version and there is still room for improvement, the app has already succeeded in creating a positive space for e-sport fans. The experience gained during this project has paved the way for further improvements and expansion, suggesting that a version 2 could be envisaged in the future.",
        "content_context_myy": "As a keen developer, I identified a recurring need in the community: to have a solid, versatile base from which to quickly start developing new applications. To meet this need, I've devoted my spare time to creating an application with a wide range of functions, both basic and complex. Although this application is not intended to be deployed on the stores, it is designed as an open source project to help other developers save time. The front end of the application is developed with Flutter, while the back end is designed in Node.js, linked to a MySQL database.",
        "challenges_content_myy": "The project involved a number of challenges, not least the creation of a modular architecture that could be easily extended. It was essential to design a base that was both comprehensive in terms of functionality and flexible enough to adapt to different needs. Integrating complex functionality while maintaining simplicity of use was a delicate balance to strike. In addition, the code had to be well commented and documented to ensure that it could be understood and used easily by other developers.",
        "results_content_myy": "The result is a robust and versatile open source application that serves as an ideal starting point for a variety of projects. It incorporates a multitude of basic functions, such as user authentication and profile management, as well as more complex functions that are useful for a variety of use cases. Thanks to its well thought-out architecture, developers can easily add, modify or remove components according to their specific needs. By making this application available as an open source resource, I hope to contribute to the developer community by enabling them to save time and optimise their efforts when creating new applications.",
        "content_context_portfolio": "In order to have a platform to showcase my work and skills in a professional and creative way, I decided to devote my spare time to creating my own personal website and portfolio. The site, designed to showcase my projects and expertise, was developed using React.js and incorporates 3D graphics created with Three.js.",
        "challenges_content_portfolio": "Developing my portfolio site presented a number of interesting challenges. The first was to create an interface that was both aesthetically pleasing and functional, capable of reflecting my identity as a developer. Integrating Three.js to add interactive 3D elements was also a challenge, as I wanted these elements to add an immersive dimension without overloading the site. What's more, the site had to be optimised for fluid browsing and cross-browser compatibility.",
        "results_content_portfolio": "The result is an elegant and interactive personal website and portfolio that effectively showcases my work and skills. The 3D elements, integrated using Three.js, add a distinctive and immersive touch, allowing visitors to engage more dynamically with the content. The site's structure, built using React.js, ensures fluid, responsive navigation. This project, carried out in my spare time, is not only a reflection of my technical skills, but also of my creativity and commitment to my professional development.",
